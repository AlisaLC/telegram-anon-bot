# Telegram Tru Anon Bot
## Introduction
Since the databases of so called anonymous chat bots are leaked. I decided to write a simple no-database version to fix the privary issue.
The database is not needed since each message is copied between the chats.
The only data that is stored in the memory is if you blocked someone and the message ids to be forwarded in the inbox.
## UX
I made minor improvement in UX like adding thread based chatting and live chatting to make it easier to use. you can also edit the texts before they are seen by the user.
I'm open to any suggestions to make life easier.
## Deployment
It's deployed in [@TruAnonBot](https://t.me/TruAnonBot).
